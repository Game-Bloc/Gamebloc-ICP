# Gamebloc

Gamebloc is the first decentralised website for hosting game tournaments which can either be crowdfunded (individually hosted tournaments) or Prepaid (funded by a gaming company trying to get their gaming apps known). Basically, a user can create a tournament with an entry fee that other users can participate in (for a particular fee), and at the end of the tournament, the pool prize is shared in percentage between the first three winners.
