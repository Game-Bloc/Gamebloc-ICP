# GameBloc: A Decentralised Platform for Game Tournaments

GameBloc is an innovative decentralised platform for hosting game tournaments, catering to both gamers and gaming organizations. With transparent, secure, and customisable tournament options, GameBloc bridges the gap between the traditional gaming world and blockchain technology.

## 🎮 **Project Highlights**
GameBloc empowers gamers and gaming organizations by offering both crowdfunded and prepaid tournament models. Players can participate in transparent, fair competitions, while organizations can customise tournament parameters, attract new audiences, and boost their game’s visibility. Our platform provides an ecosystem where rewards are managed and distributed securely via blockchain.

Target users include gaming organisations, casual and competitive gamers, and esports teams seeking a decentralised platform for organising or participating in tournaments.

## 🌐 **Web3 Advantages**
Unlike Web2 platforms, GameBloc leverages blockchain to provide an unparalleled gaming experience. With transparent prize pools, secure transactions, and decentralised management, users benefit from fairness and efficiency. Smart contracts automate tournament rewards, ensuring immediate payouts, while integrating ICP, ckBTC, and ckETH as prize pools.

Blockchain also allows us to introduce unique features like **Blitzkrieg Tournament Type**, a hybrid of prepaid and crowdfunded models, offering flexibility in entry fees and prize structures. 

## 🛠️ **How GameBloc is Built**
GameBloc is built on the Internet Computer (ICP) using Motoko and Rust for backend development. Our tournament management system and the backend canisters handle everything from tournament creation to prize distribution. Smart contracts ensure automatic payouts, and consensus-based moderation ensures fairness in determining winners.

We also implemented the **GameBloc Token** using the ICRC-1 token standard to facilitate in-platform transactions and power future tokenomics.

## 🔗 **Internet Computer Superpowers**
ICP's high-speed, low-cost transactions allow us to provide instant rewards and low-cost tournament hosting. The scalability of ICP ensures our platform can handle increasing user growth without sacrificing performance, and its decentralised nature guarantees transparency and security across all operations.

With **automated payment systems** for both crowdfunded and prepaid tournaments, GameBloc ensures instant, fast, secure reward distribution.

## 🎯 **Go-To-Market Strategy**
Our strategy includes partnerships with gaming organizations, leveraging collaborations like our **Nexal partnership** to boost visibility. We’re also tapping into the wider gaming community via social media, with over **1,000 Twitter followers** and **700+ active users**. To expand our reach, we’re incorporating gamification elements like leaderboards and achievements to promote user engagement and retention.

## 💰 **Monetization**
GameBloc operates on a transparent fee structure, earning revenue from a small fee on tournament entry and prize pools. We are also exploring tokenomics via the GameBloc token, which will incentivize tournament participation and community engagement.

## 📊 **Status of the Project**
- **Blitzkrieg Tournament Success**: Launched and successfully completed our first hybrid tournament with another scheduled right after.
- **Admin Panel Deployment**: Administration implementation for managing tournament workflows and prize distribution.
- **GameBloc Token Deployed**: Using ICRC-1 for in-platform transactions.
- **Over $2,000 in transaction volume** generated.
- **Partnership with Nexal**: To enhance outreach and user engagement.
- **700+ users on the platform** and counting.

## 🚀 **Future Plans**
GameBloc plans to expand tournament customszation, introduce more gamification features, and grow our user base. We aim to scale up partnerships with gaming organizations and onboard more players. In the long term, we will explore decentralised governance options for the community and launch new features based on user feedback.

Join us in shaping the future of decentralised gaming!
